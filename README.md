**Financial Ratios**
=====================

Financial ratios are numerical values used to evaluate a company's financial performance and health. They provide insights into a company's liquidity, 
profitability, efficiency, and solvency, helping investors, creditors, and other stakeholders make informed decisions.

**Types of Financial Ratios**

1. **Liquidity Ratios**: Evaluate a company's ability to pay its debts.
	* Current Ratio: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
	* Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio): (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
2. **Profitability Ratios**: Analyze a company's earnings and revenue.
	* Gross Margin Ratio: Gross Profit / Sales Revenue
	* Operating Margin Ratio: Operating Income / Sales Revenue
	* Net Profit Margin Ratio: Net Income / Sales Revenue
3. **Efficiency Ratios**: Assess a company's asset utilization and cost management.
	* Asset Turnover Ratio: Sales Revenue / Total Assets
	* Inventory Turnover Ratio: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
4. **Solvency Ratios**: Evaluate a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations.
	* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: Total Debt / Total Equity
	* Interest Coverage Ratio: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expenses

**Common Financial Ratios**

1. **Current Ratio**
	* Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
	* Interpretation: Measures a company's ability to pay its short-term debts.
2. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**
	* Formula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
	* Interpretation: A more conservative measure of liquidity than the current ratio, as it excludes inventory.
3. **Gross Margin Ratio**
	* Formula: Gross Profit / Sales Revenue
	* Interpretation: Measures a company's ability to generate gross profit from sales.
4. **Operating Margin Ratio**
	* Formula: Operating Income / Sales Revenue
	* Interpretation: Measures a company's profitability after accounting for operating expenses.
5. **Net Profit Margin Ratio**
	* Formula: Net Income / Sales Revenue
	* Interpretation: Measures a company's overall profitability.

**Financial Ratio Analysis**

1. **Interpretation**: Compare the ratio values to industry averages, benchmarks, or previous periods to assess performance.
2. **Comparison**: Analyze multiple ratios to identify trends and patterns in financial performance.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track changes in ratio values over time to detect trends and potential issues.
4. **Benchmarking**: Use industry averages as a baseline for comparison.

**Example:**

Suppose we have two companies, XYZ Inc. and ABC Corp., with the following financial data:

| Company | Current Ratio | Quick Ratio | Gross Margin Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| XYZ Inc. | 2.0 | 1.5 | 30% |
| ABC Corp. | 1.8 | 1.3 | 25% |

**Analysis:**

* Both companies have similar liquidity ratios, indicating they can pay their short-term debts.
* ABC Corp. has a lower gross margin ratio and quick ratio compared to XYZ Inc., suggesting it may struggle with profitability and cash flow management.
