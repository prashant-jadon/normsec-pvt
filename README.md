**Linked List**
================

### Chapter Overview

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (called a node) points to 
the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are commonly used in various applications such as dynamic memory allocation, sorting algorithms, and data 
structures.

### Key Concepts

#### Node Structure

A linked list consists of nodes that contain two main pieces of information:

*   **Data**: The actual value stored in the node.
*   **Next**: A reference to the next node in the sequence (or null if it's the last node).

+---------------+
|  Data        |
+---------------+
       |
       | Next
       v
+---------------+
|  Null/Next Node|
+---------------+
```

#### Linked List Types

There are several types of linked lists, including:

*   **Singly Linked List**: Each node only points to the next node in the sequence.
*   **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence.
*   **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure.

|  Doubly Linked|

       |
       | Prev
       v
+---------------+
|  Circular Linked|
+---------------+
```

#### Common Operations

Linked lists support several operations:

*   **Insertion**: Adding a new node at the beginning or end of the list.
*   **Deletion**: Removing a node from the list.
*   **Traversal**: Iterating through the nodes in the sequence.

```

### Detailed Explanation

#### Singly Linked List Implementation

Here's an example implementation of a singly linked list in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node

    def print_list(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" ")
            current = current.next

# Example usage:
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.insert("A")
linked_list.insert("B")
linked_list.insert("C")
print("\nForward Traversal:")
linked_list.print_list()  # Output: A B C
```

**Singly Linked List Code Explanation**

*   We define a `Node` class to represent individual nodes in the linked list.
*   Each node has two attributes: `data` and `next`.
*   The `LinkedList` class represents the entire linked list.
*   The `insert` method adds new nodes to the end of the list.
*   The `print_list` method prints the data of all nodes in the list.

```

#### Doubly Linked List Implementation

Here's an example implementation of a doubly linked list in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def insert(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            new_node.prev = self.tail
            self.tail.next = new_node
            self.tail = new_node

    def print_list(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" ")
            current = current.next

# Example usage:
doubly_linked_list = DoublyLinkedList()
doubly_linked_list.insert("A")
doubly_linked_list.insert("B")
doubly_linked_list.insert("C")
print("\nForward Traversal:")
doubly_linked_list.print_list()  # Output: A B C
current = doubly_linked_list.tail
while current:
    print(current.data, end=" ")
    current = current.prev
print()
# Output: C B A (Backward traversal)
```

**Doubly Linked List Code Explanation**

*   We define a `Node` class to represent individual nodes in the linked list.
*   Each node has three attributes: `data`, `next`, and `prev`.
*   The `DoublyLinkedList` class represents the entire linked list.
*   The `insert` method adds new nodes to the end of the list.
*   The `print_list` method prints the data of all nodes in the list using forward traversal, followed by backward traversal.
